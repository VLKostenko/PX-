    "answer": "Your trading orders are executed immediately with the \"market order\" option that you may choose on the Buy-Sell panel on the exchange page. In this case, the transaction will be executed immediately, but the effective price of the transaction will be a rate which can vary according to the conditions in the market. If you are making sale, your transaction is executed beginning from the highest bid in the market; if you are making purchase, then it is executed beginning from the lowest ask.<br><br>In the case that you’ve not chosen the market order option, you determine the price at which the transaction will be exectued. This kind of trading orders are called ‘limit orders’. In limit orders, until the price reach the level that you set, your order remains with the pending status. On the other hand, if there are already orders matching with your limit order, then your order is executed instantly like the market orders.",
